# üìÇ **Project4: Prophet Time Series Price Commodity**

## üìö *Introduction*
This project focuses on analyzing avocado pricing trends using time series analysis and forecasting techniques. Avocado prices exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, with prices typically rising in the summer and falling in the winter. By applying Prophet, a powerful forecasting model, we are able to identify and quantify the seasonal and trend components in the historical price data. This approach allows for a more accurate prediction of future price movements.

The project also explores regional differences, specifically in the U.S. market, where avocado pricing trends vary by region. While the national trend indicates a decline in prices, the West Region is expected to experience an upward price trajectory, illustrating the importance of considering regional dynamics in forecasting.

## üìù *Summary* 
In conclusion, our analysis reveals that the majority of borrowers have successfully repaid their loans, with only 17% defaulting. Firstly, the FICO score distribution is right-skewed, with most borrowers scoring between 675 and 725, and only a small proportion exceeding 775. Loans for debt consolidation have relatively low default rates, while loans for small business and education carry higher default risks. Additionally, there is an inverse relationship between FICO scores and default rates, and factors such as debt-to-income ratio (DTI), installment amounts, and revolving utilization are more strongly associated with default risk than income. Furthermore, defaults are dispersed across all income levels, with a higher concentration observed in the DTI range of 5-20. Geographically, China and France stand out with low default rates, while countries like Portugal, the U.S., and Indonesia exhibit higher default rates, indicating the need for more stringent approval processes in these regions.

## üí° *Suggestion*
* Targeted Risk Assessment for Loan Purposes: Given that loans for small businesses and educational purposes carry higher default risks, additional risk assessments could be implemented for borrowers applying for these types of loans.

* Monitor Installment Amounts and Revolving Utilization: Given the positive relationship between higher installment amounts, revolving utilization, and the risk of default, these factors should be included in predictive models to enhance accuracy.

* Given that China has high loan volumes and low default rates, it is an ideal market for lending expansion. Similarly, France, despite having smaller loan volumes, presents an attractive opportunity due to its low default rate.
