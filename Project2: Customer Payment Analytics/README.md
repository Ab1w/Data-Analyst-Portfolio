# **Project2: Customer Payment Analytics**


## 📚 *Introduction*
This project aims to analyze customer spending behaviors and preferences by integrating and cleaning three datasets. We explored the payment amount range for different payment methods (e.g., credit card, debit card) to uncover if customers using credit cards tend to spend higher amounts. Additionally, we tracked payment amounts by payment method over time, focusing on monthly and yearly trends, to identify patterns in customer behavior. By aggregating payment amounts on a monthly basis, we provided a comprehensive overview of payment activity, enabling insights that can be used to deliver personalized shopping experiences and ultimately increase revenue.
