## ðŸ“‚ **Project 1: Google-Case-Study-Cyclistic Analysis**

### ðŸ“š *Introduction:* 
This case study is based on Case 1 of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate: "How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?" Our role in this analysis is as junior data analysts on Cyclistic's marketing team, a bike sharing company located in Chicago. The Director of Marketing emphasizes that the company's future success relies on maximizing the count of annual members. Therefore, our objective is to investigate marketing strategies for converting recreational riders into annual members. To achieve this, it is crucial for us to gain an understanding of the distinct ways in which recreational riders and annual members utilize bikes.

## ðŸ“‚ **Project 2: Customer Payment Analytics**

### ðŸ“š *Introduction:*
This project aims to analyze customer spending behaviors and preferences by integrating and cleaning three datasets. We explored the payment amount range for different payment methods (e.g., credit card, debit card) to uncover if customers using credit cards tend to spend higher amounts. Additionally, we tracked payment amounts by payment method over time, focusing on monthly and yearly trends, to identify patterns in customer behavior. By aggregating payment amounts on a monthly basis, we provided a comprehensive overview of payment activity, enabling insights that can be used to deliver personalized shopping experiences and ultimately increase revenue.

## ðŸ“‚ **Project3: Loan Analytics**

### ðŸ“š *Introduction:*
This project focuses on analyzing borrower risk and default behavior using key financial factors, including FICO credit scores, debt-to-income ratios (DTI), loan purposes, and geographical differences. The goal is to segment borrowers by risk levels, identify factors influencing default rates, and explore how these variables vary across different countries. By understanding these patterns, the project aims to optimize lending strategies, improve risk assessment processes, and identify opportunities for loan expansion in stable markets, ultimately driving lending business growth.

## ðŸ“‚ **Project4: Prophet Time Series Price Commodity**

### ðŸ“š *Introduction:*
This project focuses on analyzing avocado pricing trends using time series analysis and forecasting techniques. Avocado prices exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, with prices typically rising in the summer and falling in the winter. By applying Prophet, a powerful forecasting model, we are able to identify and quantify the seasonal and trend components in the historical price data. This approach allows for a more accurate prediction of future price movements.

The project also explores regional differences, specifically in the U.S. market, where avocado pricing trends vary by region. While the national trend indicates a decline in prices, the West Region is expected to experience an upward price trajectory, illustrating the importance of considering regional dynamics in forecasting.
