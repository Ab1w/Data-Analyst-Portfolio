## ðŸ“‚ **Project 1: Google-Case-Study-Cyclistic Analysis**

### ðŸ“š *Introduction:* 
This case study is based on Case 1 of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate: "How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?" Our role in this analysis is as junior data analysts on Cyclistic's marketing team, a bike sharing company located in Chicago. The Director of Marketing emphasizes that the company's future success relies on maximizing the count of annual members. Therefore, our objective is to investigate marketing strategies for converting recreational riders into annual members. To achieve this, it is crucial for us to gain an understanding of the distinct ways in which recreational riders and annual members utilize bikes.

## ðŸ“‚ **Project 2: Customer Payment Analytics**

### ðŸ“š *Introduction:*
This project aims to analyze customer spending behaviors and preferences by integrating and cleaning three datasets. We explored the payment amount range for different payment methods (e.g., credit card, debit card) to uncover if customers using credit cards tend to spend higher amounts. Additionally, we tracked payment amounts by payment method over time, focusing on monthly and yearly trends, to identify patterns in customer behavior. By aggregating payment amounts on a monthly basis, we provided a comprehensive overview of payment activity, enabling insights that can be used to deliver personalized shopping experiences and ultimately increase revenue.
