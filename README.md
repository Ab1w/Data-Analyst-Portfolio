# 📂 **Google Case Study Cyclistic Analysis**

## 📚 *Introduction:* 
This case study is based on Case 1 of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate: "How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?" Our role in this analysis is as junior data analysts on Cyclistic's marketing team, a bike sharing company located in Chicago. The Director of Marketing emphasizes that the company's future success relies on maximizing the count of annual members. Therefore, our objective is to investigate marketing strategies for converting recreational riders into annual members. To achieve this, it is crucial for us to gain an understanding of the distinct ways in which recreational riders and annual members utilize bikes.

## 📝 *Summary* 

Our research revealed that casual riders have longer trip durations than members, especially on weekends, while members primarily ride on weekdays. Casual riders also prefer docked bikes, unlike members who favor classic and electric bikes. Additionally, ridership follows a clear seasonal trend, recovering in spring, peaking in summer, and declining sharply in winter. These findings highlight key differences in usage patterns and preferences between casual riders and members, presenting opportunities to tailor strategies for converting casual riders into members.


## 💡 *Suggestion*

* 1. Leverage Long Ride Durations: Casual riders often take longer trips, making it worthwhile to offer membership incentives for long-distance cycling. For instance, providing the first 5 kilometers for free could encourage casual riders to see the value of membership and consider upgrading.

* 2. Seasonal Membership Discounts: To boost membership sign-ups during the low-ridership winter months, offering discounted monthly or quarterly memberships can be a compelling incentive for casual riders to commit.

* 3. Seasonal Advertising Strategy: Allocate a higher advertising budget during peak ridership months (July-September) to maximize visibility and target casual riders when demand is highest. Conversely, reduce advertising spend during the off-season to optimize costs while maintaining engagement.
