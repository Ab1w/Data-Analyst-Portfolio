# üìÇ **Project2: Loan Analytics**

## üìö *Introduction*
This project aims to analyze customer spending behaviors and preferences by integrating and cleaning three datasets. We explored the payment amount range for different payment methods (e.g., credit card, debit card) to uncover if customers using credit cards tend to spend higher amounts. Additionally, we tracked payment amounts by payment method over time, focusing on monthly and yearly trends, to identify patterns in customer behavior. By aggregating payment amounts on a monthly basis, we provided a comprehensive overview of payment activity, enabling insights that can be used to deliver personalized shopping experiences and ultimately increase revenue.

## üìù *Summary* 
In conclusion, our analysis reveals that the majority of borrowers have successfully repaid their loans, with only 17% defaulting. Firstly, the FICO score distribution is right-skewed, with most borrowers scoring between 675 and 725, and only a small proportion exceeding 775. Loans for debt consolidation have relatively low default rates, while loans for small business and education carry higher default risks. Additionally, there is an inverse relationship between FICO scores and default rates, and factors such as debt-to-income ratio (DTI), installment amounts, and revolving utilization are more strongly associated with default risk than income. Furthermore, defaults are dispersed across all income levels, with a higher concentration observed in the DTI range of 5-20. Geographically, China and France stand out with low default rates, while countries like Portugal, the U.S., and Indonesia exhibit higher default rates, indicating the need for more stringent approval processes in these regions.

## üí° *Suggestion*
* Improve Credict Card Experiences: Since credit card is the most popular payment type, improving the user experience for credit card payments, like offering rewards or faster checkout may help increase customer loyalty.
  
* Target Marketing Efforts on Weekdays: With higher order volumes from Monday to Thursday, scheduling marketing campaigns and promotions during weekdays may help maximize conversions and drive increased sales.

* Target Midday Promotions: Since peak order volume occurs around midday, offering time-limited promotions or discounts during this period may help boost sales.

* Improve Logistics: The number of days in the Shipping to Delivery stage is lower than Amazon's standard, indicating a need for operational improvements. Optimizing logistics could enhance customer satisfaction and potentially reduce abandonment rates.
